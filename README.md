## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

Centering an HTML element using flexbox which was confusing when i first learned about it.

```
body {
  text-align: center;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
  font-family: 'Outfit';
  font-size: 1rem;
  height: 100vh;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}

```
